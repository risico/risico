### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Short bio:
1. Working in the financial industry for 5 years now, doing C++, Golang and Python.
2. Worked for 7 years as a CTO for an e-commerce company. Doing lots and lots and lots of PHP (and Golang). Wrote systems that handled multi-million dollars streams and hundreds of thousands of customers. 
3. Before that I worked on various contracts for companies that ranged from your mom-and-pop websites to top 50 websites (at the time).
4. And even before that I was way into gamehacking, ran gamehacking.com for a while.

In total I have around 15 years of professional work experience and a bit more than that of programming experience.
